### Further testing

Further testing was done manually.
* For first time user user stories, I have asked friends to try this website without any further instructions. There were no bugs found and UI was found to be non-ambiguous and easy to follow.
* Testing for responsiveness and other has been done on both desktop as well as mobile sizes on both Chrome and Safari.

### Known bugs
The one bug that is known is that it is still possible, yet unlikely, to get the same location twice within a game.
